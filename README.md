Locating the global minimum point of the Rosenbrock function using genetic algorithm.

## Rosenbrock Function

The Rosenbrock function, is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms, where typically ùëé=1 and ùëè=100. It is used because it has a narrow, curved valley leading to the global minimum, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the optimal solution. This characteristic makes it an excellent test for evaluating the performance and efficiency of optimization techniques. The function is defined as:

f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2
