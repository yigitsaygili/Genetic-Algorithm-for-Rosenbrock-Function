Locating the global minimum point of the Rosenbrock function using genetic algorithm.

## Rosenbrock Function

The Rosenbrock function, is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. The function is defined as: f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2, where typically ùëé=1 and ùëè=100. It is used because it has a narrow, curved valley leading to the global minimum, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge to the optimal solution. This characteristic makes it an excellent test for evaluating the performance and efficiency of optimization techniques. 

## Genetic Algorithms
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. It mimics the process of evolution to find optimal solutions to complex problems. The algorithm starts with a population of potential solutions, encoded as chromosomes. Through iterations, the algorithm applies genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population. The fittest individuals are selected for reproduction, and new generations are created, gradually converging towards better solutions. GAs are widely used in optimization, machine learning, and engineering design due to their ability to explore large search spaces and handle nonlinear, multi-objective problems.
